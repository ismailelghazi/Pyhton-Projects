We desperately need more doctors in regional areas, and the BMP program is a step in the right direction to addressing this\n2. Rural bonuses effectively promote equity in educational outcomes for students from regional areas which is fantastic\n\nCONS:\n\n1. The current program doesn't seem to be retaining rural doctors as well as it could in the long-term. Most BMP students I know at Monash plan to fulfil their minimum obligations, feel like they've \"done their part\", and then abandon rural practice. I've also heard of rich kids accepting BMPs and buying their way out of the obligations which is really concerning.\n2. It seems really weird to me that the universities purport that higher MMI scores, GAMSATs and GPAs make for selection of better doctors, but then send people with the lowest performance on these metrics to practice in rural areas. It reinforces the perception of rural practice being a sort of punishment for low grades in undergrad, like \"doing your time\" while people with higher grades get ahead faster with specialty training positions in the city\n3. Criteria for rurality seems flawed. A lot of people (including myself) are eligible for rurality because they lived in a regional area as a toddler before moving to the city and spending most of their life there. It doesn't seem like this population would necessarily be more likely to practice rurally than others so why are we eligible? Why should these students be allowed to so easily outcompete hard-working metro students? Especially those from low socioeconomic backgrounds, whose entry schemes are much less straightforward and guaranteed\n4. Female students that accept BMPs may have to move during critical years for fertility, resulting in disruption to family planning and lower life satisfaction due to career-associated fertility issues. Wanting freedom in this respect puts a lot of female students (including myself) off applying for BMPs, and may promote inequitable access to medical education.\n\nALTERNATIVES:\n\n1. Could the government mandate the movement of more specialty training positions to regional areas when realistic (e.g. with cardiology)? If someone feels like they've got a better chance of undertaking their dream specialty by moving rurally, I can imagine that this would greatly incentivise moving there.\n2. Could the government further incentivise regional practice by making salaries significantly higher?\n\nWhat do you guys think?

After multiple refreshes and still the same result, I tried to talk to the ProctorU bot but it was so goddamn annoying since it kept saying it couldn't understand me and would give me the same useless responses every single time. I then began to email ACER and ProctorU support, and looked at the subreddit to see if anyone had any similar problems. I found the ProctorU reddit account and even messaged them asking what to do in my situation, as I wanted to start my exam as soon as possible. \n\nI had intentionally booked my GAMSAT sessions for as early as possible, since my preferred study time is in the early morning and thus I thought it would be best suited to ensure an optimal performance on the exam, as I had been sleeping and waking up early for the last week in order to set up my circadian rhythm and see if it was bullshit or not. Thus, I was getting quite agitated at the fact that over half an hour had gone past and I still wasn't connected to a proctor.\n\nEventually, I got in contact with someone on the ProctorU support team, and they were able to get me connected with a proctor. I agreed to their rules or whatever, and then got my webcam and mic set up. However, right about when he asked me to show him around my room with my webcam, the proctor was like, 'mate you're not coming up on my screen'. I responded by saying, 'dude everything is working for me and did two days ago when I sat section 1 and 2, so it must be from your end'. Then the guy took control of my screen and literally just closed all the ProctorU tabs and essentially disconnected us. I then opened everything back and we reconnected, and then immediately the guy's like, 'what the hell happened', and I was like, 'cuz, why you suprised, you're the one that closed everything'.\n \nThen the guy told me to chillax and said he was going to get a ProctorU technician. The tech comes in and takes over my computer, and sees that there is no issue on my end, and says there shouldn't be anymore problems. I then get reconnected to my proctor, and the dude's like 'I still can't see you, let me get another technician'. At this point, I am just so fed up cos the last technician already said that there was no fault on my end, and so I tell this to him and suggest he susses out his own situation, but I get aired and calls the other technician anyway. It is by this time, I see that now ProctorU won't even let me sit the exam because apparently if you don't connect with your proctor by 60 minutes, you have to reschedule or something like that. \n\nThe new technician though comes in and does all the same shit as the last one did, and then requests if she can reboot my PC. At this point, I'm like 'wtf, why dude', and she's like 'nah it might fix it', and so I'm like 'bro, there's no problem here, its the proctor's computer thats fucked', and she basically just deadass responds by saying, 'can I do it or not?' I say yes, and then as my PC reboots, I just leave my desk and go for a walk around my house. I find some chocolate in the fridge and start demolishing it whilst my mum is just so lost as to why I'm so chill and not in there busting my ass in the exam.\n\nI come back, taking my time to mentally reset, and then reconnect with ProctorU. Turns out that now, along with the technician, I am connected with 3 other proctors, and that I am logged into another person's account. Let's just say this person's name was Natalie Dormer, and so I am literally logged into Natalie Dormer's ProctorU account. I can see her schedule, whatever pages she opens and her bloody profile picture on the top right hand corner of every page, and so I'm just extremely confused now, since Natalie D. isn't even one of the proctor's or technicians that I was connected to.\n\nEventually, whoever was controlling my screen exits, and my original proctor comes back and finally asks me to show me my room, ID, wrists, ears, working out paper, etc. Apparently now the situation was with their ProctorU servers, and they've fixed it up, and the guy also apologises a few times, so I'm like 'its allg bro, just let me start already'. Once I'm ready to actually begin the section 3, the time is 10:54am. Thus, it literally took me two hours and 4 minutes to begin my section 3, which is just absolutely fucking bananas. \n\nOnce I finish my 2 hours and 30 minutes of section 3, I immediately email ACER and with whatever brain power I have left, explain the situation and ask for some sort of consideration since my performances was definitely affected by that delay. While I'm writing, I also notice that ACER emailed me during those shambolic affairs and gave me an option to reschedule my exam for the next day (Sunday Sep 19), even though apparently Section 3 was only open for Friday and Saturday. In my email, I test my luck and ask if it's possible to reschedule my exam, even though I just sat it. \n\nObviously that gets rejected, but ACER do respond by offering me 10 minutes to go over my answers the next day, and so I say yes and book a session with ProctorU. After just finishing that 10 minutes, I realised that it really didn't help much, since what the fuck can you do in that time as I got overwhelmed by all the stims and couldn't really do much besides go through my answers and change one or two. Regardless, I'm happy that at least they tried to do something and so I can't really complain unless others in similar situations got better deals. \n\nDid anything similar happen to anyone this session or last time in May 2020? Has anyone else received extra time to go over their answers for any of their sections? I am interested to know if so."}, {"id": "pr1n8u", "date": "2021-09-19", "title": "Looking for some hard boiled sweet advice - Re plan B.", "text": "Mods please kick me if this is misplaced\u2026.\n\n\\*We are all anxious with Gammy results.

It was a really stressful period of my life and having never undertaken a medical interview before, I felt completely unprepared and really sympathize with those in a similar situation. I was lucky enough to get in with my first attempt, having only done about 3 or 4 job interviews (which I didn't get). Everything revolves around luck and it was nothing but pure luck that I was 1 out of 3000 to get an offer. \n\nI frequent this subreddit a lot and offer individual help from time to time but wanted to just give some general interview feedback tips which I hope will help someone out there!\n\n1. I know this gets said a lot, but be yourself. Everyone who gets an interview, has the marks and the intelligence to study med. The interview is a test of your real work experience and an opportunity to showcase your individuality. Use a variety of examples to demonstrate how you are mature, able to logically think through conflicts and scenarios and talk about aspects of your life. Have a proper think about a few scenarios that are unique to you, to help set yourself apart from others.\n \nJust a side note - at my interview group there was a guy who, during the 20 minutes before the interview, kept talking about his portfolio and about how much research he had done. Please don't be that guy. He didn't end up getting an offer to UNDS.\n\n2. SMILE, bring energy and confidence. If you are generally not a confident person (like me), fake it. You are only a few minutes away from achieving the dream! Bring that excitement! \n\n3. Don't be afraid to take a moment to think after reading the stem. It is much better than blurting out whatever is on top of your head. Take a moment to gather your thoughts, structure what you are going to say. Sometimes you will get interrupted during your opening sentences. Be prepared to jump straight to your point.\n\n4. Dress smart, neat and clean. Obviously hard to do so during lockdown (haircut wise), but present yourself professionally which will help make a good impression. The school wants to know that when they unleash you onto the hospital system, you will be able to look professional. \n\n5. If you screw up a station, dont worry and dont let it derail the rest of your interview. I completely stuffed up one station and remember the interviewers had the most confused look I have ever seen in an interviewer. I completely kicked myself after and ended up still getting in! Depending on how you do, you have probably 1 station to go a bit sub-par in\n\nI hope these tips helped and good luck! :)"}, {"id": "ppto6x", "date": "2021-09-17", "title": "PROGRAM OFFERS", "text": "Heyoooo, does anyone know how likely you are to score a position at a subsequent ranking school (ie 2-6) if you were to get knocked back by your pref 1 that you interviewed with?

It\u2019s much appreciated :)\n\nDemocracy is a process where the citizens of a state vote for a leader, a leader which commonly runs for a set period of time and maximum number of terms. Society or western society at least deems Democracy the best way to rule a nation, yet few can actually say they practice it .\n\nMany centuries ago a popular form of leadership was with kings and queens, many attainted the right to rule by birthright. In brief, they were chosen by God, and to act against would be acting against God. It is clear that Democracy is much more fairer process than autocracy, where a leader can be elected by the people, by merit. Also, Democratic countries have leaders with a fixed number of terms, making it so, not one person is leading for a large amount of time. This is advantageous, it allows new people to lead, bringing in fresh new ideas and solutions. In addition, if people don\u2019t like that leader they can vote for a new one the next election. Although, some democratic countries have other interpretations of Democracy. One example is  Russia, the leader of which is Vladimir Putin, he has been leading Russia since 2012. This means he has the lead the country for over a decade, and the basis of Democracy means someone else should lead. Although, he has made constitutional changes allowing him to lead until 2036, which had landslide support. It may be argued, that he has a lot of support in Russia, but can we say confidently all this support is genuine?\n\nOn a different point, a component of Democracy, is the power to voice your opnion, by electing a leader to rule you are involved in the process. However, there are many events that occur in government which the citizens have no control in. An example is laws passed to impose lockdowns in the United Kingdom and many other countries worldwide. Emergency powers were invoked, but they are meant to be temporary measures. What is the point of electing a leader by the principle o \nf Democracy and then society has to endure it not being practiced. The laws were barely disputed and passed at record speed, it can be argued that it saved many lives, but at what cost. The cost of people\u2019s freedom, and this example clearly shows how countries can bend what is Democratic to fit in their needs, rasising the question is Democracy actually practiced anymore.\n\nIt is clear that,  Democracy is better than other ideologies such as Autocracy, but it is seriously flawed. Many countries around the globe define themselves as Democratic, but a few actually practice it. Those who abuse the system, which can be argued to be Vladimir Putin. Wheras those who have been elected by a so called fairer process, disregard the masses in major issues such as public health.  In brief, most countires call thesemvels democratic, but in practice it is something entirely different. For the moment it may be the best form of governing a society, unless we can think of a better way in the future."}, {"id": "piho6o", "date": "2021-09-05", "title": "S2 Advice", "text": "Confidence zero in this section last time I scored 52, and I know why.

On one hand, human nature can be argued to be primitive and identical to other animal species. On the other hand, my experience in working in a warehouse , illustrates how humans have a much higher level of thinking.\n\nHuman nature is as primitive as other animals, for example a tiger killing a tiger cub. A tiger may give birth to a cub with genetic defects, causing the mother to kill her cub. From a survival perspective the cub would most likely not survive in the wild, and slow down all the other cubs.Similarily, we as humans can base our actions on the basic survival mechanism illustrated in the animal kingdom. The number of wars is clear evidence of that, take both the World wars. They were fought to stop Germany and their allies invading other territories. There could of been many other solutions, for example diplomacy and discussion, yet waging war was the action. Another example is war on terror in Afghanistan, over 2 decades fighting terrorist groups for what outcome, the cost civilian casualties and military casualties to then leave in August 2021. These wars and countless others can be argued to have been waged by humans, as they were acting on a primitive biological mechanism, killing for the purpose of survival. \n\nOn the other hand, humans aren\u2019t all as primitive, we can do things that don\u2019t benefit us in any way. Many years ago I worked as a worker in a warehouse, where I had a manager who would treat many people horiffically. I was one of her favourites, and it would be counter-productive of me to voice my opnion on her treatment on others. I got prefential treatment when it came to picking days off for holidays, first in line for overtime and she even disregarded any of my lates coming into work. However, I was brought up with set morals and values, I could not work in an environment where people were being mistreated. Similarily, many humans are the same, we want to work in a harmminous environment, because we don\u2019t want to witness the mistreatment of others. This is further supported by when we give charity, by giving money to the poor it does nothing to our own life, yet we still donate money to those in need. In my expirence in the warehouse, I did eventually speak up and this led to being mistreated just like the others, if human nature was always \u00a0primitive, I would never have spoken up.\n\nHuman nature can be argued as primitive sometimes, but in reality it is much more complex. In certain scenarios, we will prioritise our own survival over others. However, in other situations we can defy what makes sense biologically, and do things which have no benefit for own survival, but is gratifying morally. In brief, human nature is much more complex than animals, and we have evolved much more than our ancestors once were."}, {"id": "phv7k6", "date": "2021-09-04", "title": "Mainly for UK applicants but\u2026", "text": "How is everyone feeling?

Appreciate any thoughts or tips you think could strengthen this more. \n\nMany thanks!\n\n \n\n**Task A:** **\u2018In politics stupidity is not a handicap.\u2019 -** ***Napoleon Bonaparte***\n\nStupidity is not a handicap. Indeed, in politics what is a handicap is the inability to influence others. A stupid but funny and witty politician is readily forgiven, while a serious and intelligent politician is banished. This essay will define what is meant by the stupidity and politics, will explain the importance of influence in politics, and the Let us clearly defined what is meant by the terms we are addressing \u2013 \u2018politics\u2019 is primarily focused on the allocation of resources, how they should be employed and the ability to influence others to support your vision of resource allocation. We define stupidity in terms of attaining low academic grades, rather than having a low IQ per se or an inability to read others.\n\nThe ability to influence someone is pivotal to being an effective politician. A clear example of this is given to us by the rhetoric we often hear about politicians \u2013 \u201cconvincing words of a politician\u201d, the narrative they spin, spin doctors, etc. Politicians throughout time have become known as untrustworthy individuals, due to their unfulfilled promises and their convincing words. In a democratic election, potential Members of Parliament (MPs) will go around canvassing in their local electorate, attending local events, and giving speeches about their vision for the future. They will often use words and phrases such as \u201cour vision\u201d, \u201cwe will work together\u201d and \u201cnobody will be left behind\u201d, looking to convince and influence the audience with the notion that if they vote for the them, the MP will be representing and push forward their agenda at a national level. To this end, politicians will often employ talented speech writers, spin doctors and public relations professionals to spruce up their public image, help with dressing, and even tell them how best to win the hearts of the local electorate. An influential politician is someone who has the ability to win people\u2019s hearts. \n\nHowever being a successful politician and employing of the tactics above does not necessarily exclude stupidity. In recent years, politicians have been found saying some of the silliest things or have been caught in very unbecoming situations including hypocritical behaviour, sexual harassment, submitting expenses that do not meet the public expenditure requirements for excessive holidays and entertainment. I am sure you could think of a few instances yourself where a politician has behaved in a rather stupid and silly way. Stupidity, or lack of academic attainment, has not been a barrier to getting to the highest order for a politician - one of Britain\u2019s recent Prime Ministers, John Major, did not even go to university. However, one of his most infamous blights of his career, was his affair with a married woman. \n\nIn all of these various instances when held to account, what is essential to remaining within the realm of politics is their ability to flatter, to out-talk their accusers, and their possession of the \u2018gift of the gab\u2019 and to be witty. No, stupidity is not a handicap, rather the inability to manoeuver, to influence, to control the narrative about one\u2019s self is the ultimate downfall for anyone within politics. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Task B:** **We feel we are quite different from our parents and our brothers and sisters, but we are usually much more like them than we think.** \n\n\u2018The apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree\u2019 is an apt saying that conveys the closeness in nature and character between parents and children. There are many similar sayings across various cultures. Recently, many of us in the West, like to believe that we are truly different, unique and original, however our culture and our upbringing shape us in ways and depths that we do not understand. It is only over the time that we come to realise how similar we are to our parents and siblings. \n\n\u2018Familiarity breeds contempt\u2019 is a proverb that explains that when we are overexposed to a particular habit, we sometimes can look down upon it, and come to despise a habit which would inspire others. This is often the case with children and parents. In the West, the focus on individualism makes many aim to make their stamp on the world, break the mould and establish something new. Many teenagers and young people will fall out with their parents in order to become a \u2018new person\u2019 and to become \u2018true to themselves\u2019 in effort to reach this ideal. For an example, a son is brought up in a family of bakers. His father was a baker, his grandfather was a baker and his great grandfather was a baker. Growing up he saw his father waking up at 3am to start kneading the dough and preparing the bread that would be sold in the bakery that day. At first, he loved it as a child, kneading the bread, the lovely smell of pastries, the scent of bread, however as he got older and more independent, he started to hate the smell of bread. It reminded him of how his father would always be in bed by 7pm to get enough sleep ahead of his 3am start, how his father could never stay up to watch football or how he could never see him play in the concerts as a member of the orchestra. After a while, he vows never to be a baker so he can be there for his children. \n\nThe young man decides after school to go to university and becomes a teacher instead. When this young man gets married and has his own children, he is happy because he is able to go out with them in the late evenings to watch a film or attend a sports event. However, when his children get bigger, they mention \u201cYou\u2019re exactly like Grandpa, Daddy \u2013 you\u2019re always working!\u201d to his shock. Although he doesn\u2019t do the same job, his work ethic is exactly the same \u2013 he works at weekends, marking tests, he wakes up early to ensure he has prepared the lessons for his classes. Although he changed the job that he did and didn\u2019t follow in his parents footsteps, he learned what he knows about work from watching his father and this follows him later on in life. So much of who we are is based on the environment we were in, the people we watched growing up and this shapes our perspectives and approaches to life. Sometimes, in our drive to be as different from our family as possible, we find that our very approach, attitude and mannerisms echo the pattern we saw growing up. It is no wonder that \u201cthe apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree\u201d."}, {"id": "pei19w", "date": "2021-08-30", "title": "How many questions are there gonna be in the test?", "text": "I saw the info booklet and it says 47 questions, 70 minutes for S1, but when I was doing the demo for gamsat (Im doing ProctorU), it said S1 is 60 mins?\n\nAlso, has anyone been able to download the test app, I've clicked on the link to download for Mac but the tab just says \"Redirecting\""}, {"id": "pefza4", "date": "2021-08-30", "title": "Are Earplugs for remote proctoring allowed?", "text": "In the information booklet it says candidates can be given or bring their own earplugs, but I\u2019m not sure if this is allowed for September 20 remote proctoring.

Any feedback on what I could add for that would be much appreciated. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck for anyone currently sitting this years GAMSAT and thank you very much for reading this post! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs war a long-term solution for achieving peace in modern society?\n\nWar is defined as a state of armed conflict between different countries or groups and has been prevalent from as early as human beings have existed on earth. War is carried out all over the world for a myriad of reasons, such as: taking control of a state or commodity, enforcing a particular religious belief on those who disagree or in some cases or for no particular reason at all. It is extremely difficult to envision any war happening for a good cause because every war leads to high levels of violence, death and poverty. Media, television and films also portray war to be an extremely heinous undertaking, thus cementing this belief for the majority of individuals. This begs the question as to why war still occurs in the modern day and whether it has any use, in terms of ensuring long-term peace. Despite the act of war being vital in regards to protecting widely-accepted beliefs and human rights in a society, I contend that the war only ever leads to\u00a0 high levels of human misery through the increased likelihood of terrosim and negative attitudes about different races or ethnicities. Therefore, war is not a long-term solution for achieving peace in a modern society.\n\nA major issue when it comes to achieving long-term peace through the act of war is that it only ever leads to more violence and human misery in society, patricularly in the form of terrorism. Individuals or groups may decide to take revenge on their oppressors following a war and carry out acts of violence. For example, the Iraq war was responsible for the death of more than 200,000 people, including soldiers and innocent civilians. As a consequence, a number of terrorist organisations such ISIS and Al-Qaeda had advocated to their supporters to carry out vengeful acts of\u00a0 terror, such as suicide bombings and murders within the in the countries of their rival armies.\u00a0 This leads to a self-perpetuating cycle of violence because these acts of revenge only ever leads to more revenge and more people will die as a consequence in the future. Moreover, the effects of terrorism, as a byproduct of war, not only encites pain and suffering directly on individuals but also fuels negative perceptions about different groups of people. This includes racial discrimination. This can cause a larger number of hate crimes against individuals who do not share the same beliefs as those involved in the conflict, but are simply targeted because they belong to the same country or believe in the same religion. As a consequence, this creates a greater divide between groups in a society, therefore creates more violence and less peace in a society.\n\nHowever, many argue that war is crucial for protecting widely-accepted beliefs in a particular society, such as freedom and Liberty, from the hands of unjust political parties and groups.\u00a0 For example, countries all cover the world were required to fight against the NAZI party during world war 2, in\u00a0 order to prevent Germany invading parts of europe and also to stop the unethical practice of jewish persection. Despite myself agreeing with the notion that inflicting violence on another human being in any scenario is an extremely abysmal and immoral act it was certainly required at the time, in order to prevent this particular immoral practice being continued in the modern day. Moreover, the two atomic bombs dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan were responsible for the death of more than 120,000 people in 1945.\u00a0 Myself and many historians believe that this was a necessary evil, in order to put an end to world war two and also to prevent the possibility of millions all over the world also dying shortly after if this were to not happen. Therefore, in certain situations short-term misery as a consequence of war is a necessary evil, in order to ensure long-term peace in a society.\u00a0\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that war cannot ensure long-term peace in the modern day as it fuels acts of terrorism in society and creates undeserving negative attitutdes and prejudices about different groups of people."}, {"id": "pd8oy9", "date": "2021-08-28", "title": "Cartoon Analysis Help Hello!

In an epoch defined by technological progression, it appears that space exploration is the zeitgeist for billionaires. By examining this through a humanitarian lens, the injustice of such endeavours acts as a microcosm into the foibles of the human condition. Venturing outwards into the vacuum of space requires us to peer inwards into the ethics of our own action. In a world of zero gravity, we must ensure our actions are not without gravitas.\n\n\n//\n\n\n \nThe petrochemical basis upon which our society is founded is both it's becoming and downfall. The space industry is propagating this.  In pursuit of unbridled growth, humanity has exploited these natural resources, seeking infinity in the finite. This has culminated in issues on the planet unlike which we have experienced before. The exploitation of carbon based resources has given rise to climate change, occuring at unprecedented rates. The flooding in Utrecht, fires in Portland and people in Canada dying due to thermoregulatory failure is testimony to this. The severity of these changes has called into question the morality of individualistic space travel, which uses these resources. Earlier this summer, tycoons Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos took their first dip into the cosmos, travelling past the Karman line. These trips, while undoubtedly incredible to bear witness to, worsen our scenario on Earth. It sets a dangerous precedent, also. In a world in which escape from the throes of a dying planet is confined to an elite few, an attitude of apathy towards our planet's wellbeing is at risk. Bezos was all too aware of the severity of his actions, donating two hundred million dollars to charities upon returning. The ethics of bribery in an effort to mask unethical behaviour is dangerous in the workplace. Yet, on a planetary scale, it is unacceptable. It is inherently misanthropic. This is not to say that space travel is without merit, however. It breeds technological advancement, as exemplified by the cold war during the mid 20th century, in which leaps of colossal proportion were made in regards to solar and radio technology. This was afforded by space travel. Yet, intergovernmental cooperation in space is senescing and rapidly being replaced by individualistic pursuits. We must ensure that our technological advancement and pursuits does not forgo the necessary accompanying morality.\n \n\n\n//\n\n\n\n\nSpace travel's foundation lies within escapism. Throughout the anthropocene, humanity has always gazed outwards. The modality is transmutable, ranging from organised religion to folklore but the predominant form in the twenty first century is space exploration. The crux of this desire lies within the foibles of each of us. We seek extrospection rather than introspection, we believe the answer lies beyond our grasp. By looking to the stars, it enables us to abandon the thoughts and responsibility of our actions on Earth. This is an attitude that must be mitigated, to gaze outwards absolves us of responsibility. It is necessary we scrutinise our planetary shortcomings and mistreatment, question our behaviour, in order to fix our planet. The answer to the problems we have created on Earth lies within us. The genesis of this scenario lies within us and we must address it. Our behaviours must be altered even at the cost of comfort. By adopting a more holistic approach to the planet, we can create a domain for posterity, rather than mere archetypes of our shortcomings. Despite humanity's proclivity to guessing what lies over the horizon, we must make our last stand in the present.\n \n\n//\n\n\n\nThe question of space travels requires deep introspection. The vacuum of space is an enigmatic place where entropy reigns. The ethical question of our desire to explore it bears the same enigma and we must ensure it's characterised by order."}, {"id": "p8sbu1", "date": "2021-08-21", "title": "Portfolio for UNDA/UoW", "text": "Is there a non disclosure agreement when it comes to portfolios for UNDA/UoW?

And there isn't many job opportunities for most doctors coming out of training now. \n\nAsk me anything about training and life as a doctor.\n\nEdit: thanks for all your questions. These are obviously my personal opinions and you should take it with a grain of salt, as with anything on the internet.  A couple of takeaway points from my experience. \n\n1. Medicine is a really really long slog, that's extremely testing mentally and physically, especially during training. I wish someone would have explained this to me when I first started.  I've seen some brilliant people get destroyed by the training process.  \n2. Don't put medicine on a pedestal. It's a good career, but it's just a job at the end of the day. Plenty of of good candidates don't get in, and it's not always fair. But you will probably be amazing in another career and contribute to society in other ways.  \n3. Medicine isn't what it used to be. There are less and less training positions and less and less jobs. With more and more people competing for them. \n4. If you do get in to med school. Enjoy it. The uni part was my fav part. It's lots of fun and the stress of being a doctor won't hit for a few more years. But still try and get good scores, not only for your knowledge but also it may affect your career down the track.\n5. On balance medicine is still a decent career that offers job satisfaction, relative job security, good pay and interesting work.  Good luck to you all.\n\nEdit 2: I thought it was a good idea to share some of my experiences. Obviously many people here don't like what I've shared and have been quite combative.

Admittedly, preparing for the GAMSAT has been hugely demoralizing. No matter how much I engage in my studies, I cannot seem to score well on my ACER tests, looking at about only 60% of questions correct. It is very apparent my best isn\u2019t good enough. I have never sat the exam before and the impending doom of the September sitting is becoming very overwhelming. As a result, I have been suffering from minor panic attacks when I sit down to study. Can anyone please advice on how they dealt with the dehumanization that is studying for the GAMSAT? How have you all dealt with your feelings of inadequacy? I am eager to hear any nuggets of advice."}, {"id": "p6vzqo", "date": "2021-08-18", "title": "Did you find ACER or Des more indicative of the real exam?", "text": "I\u2019ve heard both tbh!
